                        robots and modeling complex dynamic systems by using nonlinear geometric methods, 
                        optimization, and machine learning. We are looking to hire PhD students (with competitive 
                        graduate assistantship offered) with the following qualifications: <br />
                        - Bachelor’s degree in electrical, mechanical, computer engineering or related areas. <br />
                        - Experience with MATLAB, Python, C++ (preferred), Solidworks (preferred), etc. <br />
                        - Good written and oral communication skills. <br />
                        - Motivated to learn new skills and explore new areas. <br />

                        <br />
                        The RoLAC lab has openings for highly motivated undergraduate and Master's students interested in robotics, control, 
                        and deployment of the technology for real-world applications. Please email Dr. Chen to express interest in joining the group.
                        I will schedule a meeting to discuss specific projects that would fit your interests and background. Note that students 
                        without the desired background will still be considered provided they show interest/passion for the project and 
                        committment to developing the required skills.

                <h2>Advising Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I believe that a major goal of an advisor is to guide 
                        you to succeed in a career you are passionate about. In order to achieve it, I adopt the 3A's mentoring: active listening,
                        availability, and analysis. I would expect you to actively reach out to me whenever you need help or advice. 
                        As an advisor, I ensure to block a weekly time slot for our individual meeting to make sure you are on the right track
                        and we are on the same page about our research. There is almost nothing more rewarding than seeing my students succeed. 
                        I will encourage you to apply for awards, fellowships, and similar opportunities,
                        and work with you to help you achieve your career goal(s).
