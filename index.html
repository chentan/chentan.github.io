          <p>
            The Computational Mechanics and Optimization (CaMO) Lab (PI: Matthew J. Zahr)
            develops mathematical models, numerical methods, and software for the analysis,
            optimization, and uncertainty quantification of physics problems that arise
            in a range of applications in science, engineering, and medicine. Active
            research directions include: the development of fast and accurate
            model reduction methods to enable large-scale many-query analyses and
            real-time, high-fidelity computational physics simulations; accurate,
            efficient, and automated numerical methods for high-speed flows;
            high-order methods for
            computational physics; high-order and reduced-order methods for topological
            optimization and its role in additive manufacturing; PDE-constrained
            optimization; and multiscale methods. Application areas of interest
            include: combustion and energetic materials, aerodynamics (including
            hypersonic systems), biological flows, and flapping flight.
            Their methods and software have been used for aerodynamic shape optimization,
            topological optimization of nonlinear structures, structural dynamics of
            highly heterogeneous materials, and to discover energetically optimal
            flapping wing motions.
