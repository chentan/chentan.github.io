                <p>
                    I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechnical
                    Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In my senior year, I pursued two-year studies 
                    at Ecole des Mines de Douai in France, thanks to the Eiffel scholarship program,
                    and received a dual Master's degree in Automation. In France, I also interned in Atos Wordline and Renault Group.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, advised by Prof. <a href="https://controls.ame.nd.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">Bill Goodwine</a>. 
                    My PhD thesis focused on biped robots and geometric nonlinear control theory.
                    At Notre Dame, I also worked closely with Profs. <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/james-schmiedeler/">James Schmiedeler</a> 
                    and <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/">Patrick Wensing</a>. I was also a teaching assistant for several 
                    robotics and controls courses, and won the Outstanding Graduate Student Teaching Award.

                <br />
                <p>
                    I completed my Postdoc training in the 
                    <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu">Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL)</a> at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 
                    I was fortunate to work with Profs. <a href="http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu">Timothy Bretl</a>, 
                    <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/">Katie Driggs-Campbell</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/people/amato/">Nancy M. Amato</a>  on an industry-funded research project on smart manufacturing. 
                    My postdoc work was improving efficiency, robustness, and flexibility in industrial assembly through integration of computer vision, 
                    robot learning and control, motion planning and human-robot interaction.

                    I was born and raised in a suburb of Wuhan, which is the largest city in Central China and well
                    known as
                    &ldquo;Jiang Cheng&rdquo; (the city on the Yangtze river).

                    I attended Shanghai Jiao Tong University, for both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechnical
                    Engineering.
                    In my senior year, I was honored to receive the Eiffel scholarship, which enabled me to study at
                    Ecole des Mines de Douai in France for two years and receive a dual Master's degree in Automation.
